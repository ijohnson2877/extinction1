					<h2>The Dire Wolf</h2>
						<p> The dire wolf (Canis dirus) is an extinct species of the genus Canis. It is one of the most famous prehistoric carnivores in North America along with its extinct competitor Smilodon, the "sabre-toothed cat". The Dire Wolf most resembles the Gray Wolf. Canis dirus lived in the Americas during the Late Pleistocene epoch (125,000â€“10,000 years ago). The species was named in 1858 but the first specimen had been found in 1854 in Ohio, USA.<p>

					<h2> The Myths</h2>
						<p>Dire Wolves have always been attributed to fierce, 'larger than life' wolf-like creatures. Ever since their discovery in 1854, many have placed the Dire Wolf in a grotesquely over-exaggerated category of gigantic monstrous saber-toothed, green eyed demons. Of course it never really was, but fantasy and reality blur in our minds when we think of this large predatory creature that ruled prehistoric history. Because canis dirus is now extinct, our minds run wild with illusion as we try to imagine the Dire Wolf in that harsh icy world. </p>

					<h2> The Size</h2>
						<p>Canis dirus was the largest of all Canis species. A study of the length and circumference of femur bones estimated the mean body mass of Canis dirus guildayi to be 60 kg (130 lb) and Canis dirus dirus to be 68 kg (150 lb).[18] Another study proposed that the increased stress caused in the humerus when running at maximum speed may have imposed a biomechanical upper limit on the body mass for Canis dirus dirus to be 110 kg (240 lbs).</p>

					<h2>Habitat</h2>
						<p>Canis dirus remains have been found across a broad range of habitats including the plains, grasslands and some forested mountain areas of North America, and in the arid savannah of South America. The sites range in elevation from sea level to 2,255 m (7400 feet).[17] The location of its fossil remains suggests that it lived predominantly in the open lowlands along with its prey the large herbivores.</p>
