					<h2>The Dire Wolf</h2>
						<p> The dire wolf (Canis dirus) is an extinct species of the genus Canis. It is one of the most famous prehistoric carnivores in North America along with its extinct competitor Smilodon, the "sabre-toothed cat". The Dire Wolf most resembles the Gray Wolf. Canis dirus lived in the Americas during the Late Pleistocene epoch (125,000â€“10,000 years ago). The species was named in 1858 but the first specimen had been found in 1854 in Ohio, USA.<p>

					<h2> The Myths</h2>
						<p>Dire Wolves have always been attributed to fierce, 'larger than life' wolf-like creatures. Ever since their discovery in 1854, many have placed the Dire Wolf in a grotesquely over-exaggerated category of gigantic monstrous saber-toothed, green eyed demons. Of course it never really was, but fantasy and reality blur in our minds when we think of this large predatory creature that ruled prehistoric history. Because canis dirus is now extinct, our minds run wild with illusion as we try to imagine the Dire Wolf in that harsh icy world. </p>
